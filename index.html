    <h2> The French term "Viennoiserie" encompasses a delectable array of pastries, including the iconic croissant,
     and pays homage to their roots in Vienna, Austria. Viennese bakers were renowned for their expertise in creating
     exquisite pastries, which eventually made their way to France. The croissant, with its delicate layers and buttery 
     flavour, quickly became a staple of French bakeries and breakfast tables. Despite its Austrian origins, this pastry
     became synonymous with French culinary culture, symbolising elegance and indulgence. Today, Viennoiseries like croissants,
     pain au chocolat, and brioche delight palates worldwide, served in various iterations such as pastry boxes, reflecting the
     rich and diverse heritage of European pastry craftsmanship.
